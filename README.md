# Ng-Redux

This repo reimplements the programming assignments from Andrew Ng's Cousera Machine Learning course. The assignment pdf files and data files are Coursera's and under their control. All the python code is mine and maybe reproduced, altered and used for any purpose, with attribution. Although you can probably find more efficient implementations elsewhere. :)
